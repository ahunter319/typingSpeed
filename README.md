#Typing Speed Test

---

This is a desktop app where the user gets sixty seconds to type as many words from the prompt as they can. Only accurately typed words count towards the final score. When the timer runs out, a pop-up window will appear and display the final correctly typed word count, as well as the user's percent accuracy of typed words. Resetting the test can be done with a simple button click, and a new prompt will be generated.

###How to use

___

Simply download the executable, double click, and start typing! Or you could always run it from the command line, if you're feeling fancy.  Unfortunately the program will only work on Windows. Sorry Mac/Linux users!
